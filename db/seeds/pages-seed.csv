Her warmth, respect and professionalism show how such partnerships can lead to deeper trust and better outcomes time and again.

"Heritage Society recognizes planned gift donors, honors President Benson’s retirement","On their last day as President and First Lady of the University of Colorado, Bruce and Marcy Benson celebrated members of the CU Heritage Society at its annual luncheon at the Denver Country Club on June 28.
""You help push this university forward, and I can't thank you enough,"" Benson told guests during his remarks. ""And, Marcy, I couldn't do this job without you.""
The luncheon had 300 guests in attendance and featured a special performance by Lark, an all-female student a capella group from CU Denver. The student group benefits from gifts made by Heritage Society member and CU alumnus Doug Tashiro ('71) who was highlighted in a video played during the event.
Tashiro's generosity to CU supports his passions for both music and engineering, including tutoring for engineering students at CU Denver, the alumni choir at CU Boulder and scholarships for students in the Golden Buffaloes marching band, and student a capella groups at CU Denver.
Jack Finlaw, President and CEO of the CU Foundation, introduced Benson, CU's longest standing president in 65 years. Benson officially retired at the end of June, with Mark R. Kennedy taking the helm July 1.
Finlaw called Benson's last day on the job ""bittersweet"" for the university but reminded the crowd that Bruce and Marcy Benson were still very much a part of the CU family. Benson is an alumnus of CU Boulder and has been involved with the university long before he became president in 2008. The couple are longtime philanthropic supporters of CU, as well as members of the Heritage Society.
Benson told attendees that even on his final day he had work to do for CU, and that ""it takes a team"" to do what the university does for Colorado and the world. He said he was proud of CU's achievements during the past 11 years, including increases in student enrollment, research funding, financial aid, and fundraising, as well as the cultural transformation at CU as a university system with four distinct and dynamic campuses.
The University of Colorado Heritage Society honors those who have made a gift to support the University of Colorado through their estate plans. The Heritage Society has more than 1,300 members, with 126 new members inducted this year. Planned gifts help strengthen CU's academic programs, attract world-class faculty, fuel innovative research, advance healthcare, and support CU students on every campus in every discipline.

Financial Updates | Upcoming Meetings | Campus News and Fundraising Highlights
Dear fellow Foundation Trustees
Welcome to the DashBOARD, our newsletter for CU Foundation trustees.
There is much excitement and signs of spring at the University of Colorado following a very cold and snowy winter. All of us at the CU Foundation and CU Advancement are waiting with great expectations the results of the CU presidential search. You can find an update on the presidential search here. We are all grateful that Margaret Bathgate, our fellow trustee and former board chair, is a member of the presidential search committee. Margaret is thereby able to represent the perspectives and interests of the CU Foundation and trustees in this important discernment process for CU.
As you all no doubt are aware, we launched the public phase of our $4 billion Essential CU campaign in January. In his newsletter in February, President Benson articulated well the reasons why the Essential CU campaign is so important to the future of CU. We have received tremendous positive feedback on the campaign’s messages and ambitious goals. We are more than half way to our $4 billion goal in large part thanks to your philanthropic support during the campaign’s quiet phase. Current and former trustees have contributed almost $100 million to the Essential CU campaign so far and your giving to CU constitutes 18% of all gifts from individuals to the campaign. You can learn more about the Essential CU campaign here.
All trustees are encouraged to visit the CU Foundation’s website regularly for the latest information about the work we are doing. At the website, you will find the Foundation’s 2018 Annual Impact Report to Investors, our most recent audited financial statements and IRS Form 990, and the FAQ document we released late last year.
Upcoming in the weeks ahead is the annual joint meeting of the Foundation’s Finance/Operations Committee and Investment Policy Committee to hear from the Foundation’s investment advisors and to assess the Foundation’s Endowment Spending Policy in light of current macroeconomic trends and the investment marketplace. This work is necessary because committee members and the Foundation’s directors take seriously their fiduciary duty to ensure that the endowment funds the Foundation holds for the benefit of CU grow at least on par with inflation while at the same time paying out the highest amounts possible to support each endowment’s intended purpose. The Foundation’s Board of Directors will consider the recommendations of these committees when in June it sets the Endowment Spending Policy for next fiscal year.
I am pleased to report that while the financial markets took a tumble at calendar year end, CU’s endowments were all “above water” at December 31 and so all of the endowments will make their annual 4% of market value distributions this year. And, speaking of investment results, here is a fun graphic showing the LTIP’s 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year investment results as compared to the investment results of our PAC-12 peer institutions. Let’s hope that the Buffs can match this track record in the decade ahead!
I look forward to seeing all of you at our next trustees gathering at the Garden of the Gods and the UCCS campus on May 2 and 3. Chancellor Reddy and his team will be hosting us for cocktails and dinner on Thursday evening as UCCS launches its Campaign to Fuel Success, which is part of the system-wide Essential CU campaign. This will also be the final trustees meeting during President Benson’s term of office.
In this season of transitions, as President Benson prepares to retire after eleven years at CU’s helm, Bruce and Marcy have been saluted at campus events for their more than a decade of making a difference for CU. The CU Foundation will join the chorus of praise and recognition when we host a special cocktail reception honoring the leadership, accomplishments and service of Bruce and Marcy Benson. This garden party for all trustees and major donors will be at the Denver Country Club the evening of June 11. Save the date and watch for your invitation in the mail.

Distributions from this newest fund will provide support for an annual lecture in the department of chemistry. The lectures will focus on chemical subjects of broad interest, appealing to students and faculty in chemistry and, when possible, a broader audience including scientists, engineers and mathematicians.
Professor Mary Guy has established the Mary E. Guy Endowed Professorship Fund in Public Administration, which will be funded with lifetime and testamentary gifts. Guy joined the School of Public Affairs in 2008; her research focuses on public administration with special emphasis on the human processes involved in public service delivery.

Financial Updates | News Items | Upcoming Meetings | Campus News and Fundraising Highlights
Dear colleagues,
Welcome to the DashBOARD, our quarterly newsletter for CU Foundation trustees.
We are celebrating another successful year as we close our books on fiscal year 2018—a period that saw a record-breaking number of philanthropic gifts given to CU through the Foundation and a year that produced outstanding investment returns for CU’s endowments.
Almost 54,400 generous alumni, parents, staff and other friends of the University of Colorado supported the students, faculty, programs and research at CU through 72,370 philanthropic gifts and commitments totaling $440.4 million during FY18. Gifts to the Foundation for the benefit of CU totaled $233 million, or $46 million more than last year, and we established 122 new endowments. CU Foundation trustees collectively contributed over $5.2 million to CU in FY18. Thank you!
At June 30, 2018, CU’s 2,757 endowments managed by the Foundation were valued at $1.36 billion and the Foundation’s Long Term Investment Pool (the “LTIP”) was valued at $1.67 billion. The LTIP is invested prudently in a diversified portfolio of asset classes to protect against market volatility and to ensure long-term growth greater than annual spending and inflation. The LTIP saw investment gains of 11.07% in FY18.
Our external auditors at EKS&H are now working with our finance and accounting team and our Audit Committee to finalize the Foundation’s audited financial statements for FY18. For the first time in our history, the CU Foundation holds assets for the benefit of CU totaling in excess of $2 billion. We will post our FY18 audited financial statements on our website in late October.
In June, the Foundation’s Board of Directors approved our operating budget for FY19. With $31.4 million in revenue expected this year, expenses are budgeted to include $5.2 million for the Foundation’s operating costs, $2.4 million for investments in advancement-related IT projects and $22.4 million to fund a portion of CU Advancement’s operating costs. The Foundation expects to end the fiscal year with an operating surplus that will help grow our unrestricted net assets.
This summer the Foundation’s Board of Directors also approved spending $20.7 million of unrestricted net assets for programs and projects prioritized by CU. Half of these funds will be used to support student mental health services and mental health research at CU Boulder. The balance of the funds will be spent for facilities and programs at UCCS and CU Denver and to grow the advancement infrastructure at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus.
This is all terrific news for the University of Colorado and the CU Foundation community. CU is essential! We thank you for providing our students, faculty and staff with the means to be successful. Investors like you are the key to advancing CU’s mission.
As we come to the end of a busy summer, we look forward with great expectations to the new fall season and our trustee gathering at CU Boulder in November. We begin on Thursday evening, November 15, with a reception and special movie screening in the Touchdown Club. On Friday morning, November 16, Chancellor Phil DiStefano and Vice Chancellor for Advancement Deb Coffin with share insights on innovations occurring on the Boulder campus, President Benson will give us an update on University matters and Steve Halvorsen of Monticello Associates will offer his independent assessment of the Foundation’s investment policies and returns. Those trustees who can stay in Boulder for the weekend will have the opportunity to spend a fall afternoon or evening at Folsom Field cheering on the Buffs.
CU in November!

Trustees invited to apply for presidential search committee
This month the Board of Regents will initiate a national search for the next president of the University of Colorado to succeed our esteemed President Bruce Benson when he retires in July. The Regents’ goal is to have the search completed by spring of 2019 with the intention of having the new president start in July.
Earlier this month, the Board of Regents elected Regents Heidi Ganahl and Irene Griego to co-chair the search committee. (Heidi is also a CU Foundation trustee.) The Board of Regents uses a search committee to ensure that CU’s faculty, students, staff, alumni and community members have a voice in the search process. Under the regent policy for the presidential search, the composition of the search committee is:

A dean of a school, college or library
Four faculty members who are members of the Faculty Senate, one representing each campus
One student
One staff member
Two alumni/ae
Four community members

In appointing the members of the search committee, the Board of Regents will strive to appoint a diverse committee that includes a variety of backgrounds, expertise and perspectives to represent the interests of the university and the state.
CU Foundation trustees are invited to apply for membership on the search committee. Submission of applications closes on October 8, 2018. Please apply through the website the Board of Regents has established to accept nominations. Note that search committee meetings are expected to take place in the later afternoon/early evening on Tuesdays. A full schedule of meetings will be posted once the committee membership is set.
Leadership transitions at the CU Foundation
Our fall trustees meeting will mark a time of transition for the CU Foundation’s volunteer leadership.
At Foundation gatherings in November, we will fete Margaret Bathgate and express our appreciation to her for her two years of gracious and effective leadership as chair of the CU Foundation’s board of directors. During Margaret’s tenure as chair, we celebrated the Foundation’s 50th anniversary, we achieved record-breaking fundraising growth, our investments outperformed most of our peer institutionally-related foundations, we changed our advancement funding model to make it more equitable for endowment donors and we hosted some truly transformative trustee meetings on the campuses. During her eight years as a director, Margaret also was vice chair of the board, chair of the Governance Committee and chair of a CEO search committee. It is good news that Margaret will continue to advocate for and serve CU as a trustee and member of the advisory board for the Center for Women’s Health Research at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus.
Two other directors who have made significant contributions to our successes are exiting the board due to term limits. Dave Baker, who for many years has chaired the Finance/Operations Committee, and Jim Linfield, who chaired the board from 2014 to 2016 and who is a member of the Investment Policy Committee, will step off the board of directors this fall. Both Dave and Jim will remain involved with CU as trustees. Dave also will continue his affiliation with the Graduate School of Banking at CU Boulder and Jim will serve as a non-director member of the Investment Policy Committee.
Margaret will pass the chair’s gavel to Mike Imhoff, currently the vice chair of the board of directors, chair of the Governance Committee and a member of both the Investment Policy Committee and the Finance/Operations Committee. Mike begins his two-year term as chair of the board of directors on November 16. Mike received his BS degree in finance and international finance from the business school at CU Boulder. Mike succeeded on the academic side at CU Boulder despite (or maybe because of) the many hours he spent as an undergraduate running Ralphie around Folsom Field on fall weekends. Mike has been an active volunteer at CU Denver where he has served on the business school advisory board since 2002. Mike is an experienced community leader - he currently serves on the boards of the Denver Area Boy Scouts and the Denver Botanic Gardens. In his professional life, Mike is a managing director of the investment firm Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. in Denver. Mike and his wife and CU sweetheart Patty, who herself has two degrees from the University of Colorado, have two daughters Katie and Grace.
Mary Sissel, currently chair of the Membership Committee, will be vice chair of the board and chair of the Governance Committee effective November 16. Mary has a BS in English and Mathematics from Iowa State and an MA in Communications from Ball State. A retired law firm administrator, Mary is an active community volunteer. She is a past chair of the Craig Hospital Foundation board of directors and a former member of the Craig Hospital board of directors. In 2015, Mary chaired the successful $50 million capital campaign for Craig Hospital. Mary currently is co-chairing the Rocky Mountain PBS capital campaign. Mary also is past chair of the Center for Women’s Health Research Advisory Board at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus, the Women’s Foundation of Colorado and the Denver Foundation. Mary is very familiar with higher education foundations having served as chair of the boards of both the Ball State University Foundation in Indiana and the Front Range Community College Foundation here in Colorado. Mary is married to George Sissel, a former chair of the CU Foundation board. They enjoy spending time with their children and grandchildren in Denver.
Four trustees will join the Foundation’s board of directors for three-year terms beginning on November 16. We welcome their breadth of experience and expertise and their passionate investment of their time and treasure in CU.
Bob Eastman, who received dual degrees in economics and engineering from CU Boulder and an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, has been a trustee since 2005. Prior to that, Bob served on the CU Boulder Arts & Sciences Advisory Board for five years. Bob retired in 2012 from The Boston Company Asset Management where he was a qualitative analyst and then a portfolio manager. Bob lives in Marco Island, Florida. He serves on the board of the Boston Lyric Opera, he is a member of the Marco Island Beach Advisory Committee and he handles singer registration for the New England Region Auditions of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.
Kevin Kratt, the president and founder of Kratt Commercial Properties, a Colorado Springs based shopping center development and brokerage firm, has been in the shopping center industry in Colorado for over 30 years. Kevin and his business partner recently completed the University Village Colorado (UVC) shopping center directly across from the UCCS campus. UVC has created a scholarship program in public art for undergraduate sculpture students. Kevin is the recipient of the University Medal presented by CU’s Board of Regents, and he is a member of the UCCS Chancellor’s Ambassadors, UCCS Regional Connect, a business advisory committee, the UCCS Sports Booster Club and the fundraising committee for the Ent Center for the Performing Arts. Kevin and his wife Jamie live in Colorado Springs.
Gary Meggison received both his BS in Civil Engineering and his MBA from CU Denver. Gary now is one of CU Denver’s outstanding alumni leaders with a focus on support for the engineering and business schools. At CU Denver, Gary serves on the Engineering Leadership Council and the Chancellor’s Development Committee, and he is the Fund for CU chair. In 2003, Gary received the Alumni Mack Easton award. In his business career, Gary provides owner’s rep services for all phases of commercial construction to building and property owners, developers and project investors in the Denver metro area and along the Front Range. Gary is a past president of the Associated General Contractors. Gary and his wife Kathy enjoy spending time with their daughter Emily.
Heather Mulvihill has a BA in Psychology from Lynchburg College and an MA in Counseling Psychology from the University of Denver. She has worked as a mental health consultant helping individuals and families identify treatment programs and services to meet their needs. Heather is a founding leader of the Helen and Arthur E. Johnson Depression Center at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus and she has served as the Depression Center’s board chair since 2014. She plays a key role in the center’s fundraising and board and organizational development. Heather has been involved with several local educational organizations as well. She is currently a trustee of the Kent Denver School and she has served on the boards of the Denver Venture School and the Joshua School. Heather and her husband Jimmy live in Greenwood Village.

Highlights of the August trustees meeting at CU Denver
CU President Bruce Benson, CU Denver Chancellor Dorothy Horrell, CU Foundation board chair Margaret Bathgate and Advancement and Foundation leaders welcomed trustees to a sneak(er) peek at the new Lola & Rob Salazar Student Wellness Center at CU Denver on Thursday evening, August 16. Chancellor Horrell reminded trustees about the leadership role the students played in getting this ambitious new structure built and equipped. Amber Long, the center’s executive director, spoke about the role the wellness center will play in building community. Trustees participated in behind-the-scenes tours of the new facility. Clad in sneakers and casual attire, trustees had the opportunity to play games located around the gym floor during the cocktail reception. Quite a few competitive teams formed that evening!
On Friday, August 17, trustees met at CU Denver’s Lawrence Street Center for University and Foundation updates from President Benson and Jack Finlaw. Katy Kotlarczyk, who leads CU Advancement’s planned giving team, spoke and led a brainstorming session about planned giving options at CU. Carol Frank, chair of the Trustee Engagement Committee, and members of the committee shared their plans for hosting salons, tours and other events for trustees in the year ahead.
Chancellor Horrell provided trustees with an overview of her vision for the CU Denver campus and shared some highlights about the things that CU in the City is doing to connect with Denver’s business and government leaders. Trustees were treated to another sneak peek when Nolbert Chavez, CU Denver’s chief of external initiatives, led trustees on a tour of the new CityCenter ahead of its official grand opening slated for October 10. The CityCenter is CU’s front door to Denver – it will enable students and faculty to build partnerships with civic leaders. The morning concluded with A Brief History of Urban Development presented by Ken Schroeppel, an assistant professor in the Urban and Regional Planning Department of the College of Architecture and Planning. Trustees deeply appreciated Professor Schroeppel’s engaging lecture, the slides from which are accessible here.
A highlight of our two days on campus was the opportunity for all of us to meet and get to know Melisa Baldwin. Melisa joined CU Denver in early August as Vice Chancellor for Advancement. Trustees expressed how they look forward to working with Melisa and her advancement team in the years ahead to be sure that CU in the City has the financial resources it needs to accomplish the grand vision articulated by Chancellor Horrell.

Campus Private Support Highlights for April-June 2018
CU Anschutz

The UCHealth Eye Center program was renamed for longtime benefactor Sue Anschutz-Rodgers, who has made leadership gifts to accelerate innovative research, speed the development of new therapies and devices, and enhance clinical care. The Sue Anschutz-Rodgers Eye Center is headquartered in the Rocky Mountain Lions Eye Institute building at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus, which sees more than 100,000 patient visits annually.
Morton Mower, MD, and his wife, Toby, recently completed a $250,000 commitment to the CU Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. Their giving supports the cutting-edge research of Dr. David Ross and Dr. David Siegel in advancing human health through the development of new approaches to modifying cellular functions through electrical stimulation.
In April, Patty Hoehle updated her planned giving documentation to include an additional $142,000 gift to the Singleton Hoehle Research Fund. This gift supports Parkinson’s disease research with the goal of improving patient lives. With Patty’s support, we may one day be able to prevent or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease.
Boot Campaign pledged $120,000 to the Boot Campaign Health and Wellness Program. This funding aims to enhance the holistic treatment available at CU Anschutz for veterans recovering from the invisible wounds of war. This new program partners with the Marcus Institute for Brain Health to provide a continuum of care.

CU Boulder

Trustee Richard Brown (Fin ’54) and his wife Joyce Brown continued their investment in the BioFrontiers Institute’s research and programs by contributing $1 million to help fund emerging priorities. At the discretion of BioFrontiers Institute Director and Nobel Laureate Tom Cech and Chief Scientific Officer Leslie Leinwand, the funds will support recruitment of talented and entrepreneurial faculty and the acquisition of emerging technology for scientific computation, bio-imaging, and next-generation sequencing. Committed to higher education, the Browns have supported numerous initiatives on all CU campuses.
Through a $50,000 investment, CU Boulder supporters Bryan (Econ ’88) and Katey (A&S ex ’89) McCollam are strengthening the Athletics Psychological Health and Performance (PHP) program. The program exists to provide full support for all of the psychological needs of CU student-athletes, from the time they arrive on campus until well after they graduate. Katey and Bryan, who is also a CU Foundation trustee, have been supporting CU Athletics for years and view the PHP program as a significant priority. They believe that psychological health should be a focus not only at CU, but also nationwide.

CU Denver

In 2013, Jake Jabs, the founder, president and CEO of American Furniture Warehouse, made a $10 million gift to CU Denver Business School to educate young entrepreneurs and innovators at the newly created Jake Jabs Center for Entrepreneurship. Part of this gift was intended to eventually provide a physical home for the Jabs Center at the heart of the Business School, which envisioned it as a place to showcase student and community entrepreneurial activity as well as a location in which the business community could meet to strategize and share knowledge. While programs created through the Jabs Center, such as The Climb entrepreneurship competition continue to flourish, changes in the Denver real estate market and rapidly rising costs of construction constrained the creation of space dedicated to the Jabs Center in the Business School. To realize his intent for the namesake center, Jake Jabs recently contributed another $2 million, which will allow the Business School to commence construction on the center’s space this fall. The entire project is due to be completed in the late fall 2019, and the students and faculty will move into the new space as early as the spring semester of 2020.
The Buell Foundation provided $448,483 in continued funding for the Buell Fellows as part of the Buell Early Childhood Leadership Program. Now in its 10th year, the Buell Early Childhood Leadership Program is an 18-credit, graduate-certificate program offered in partnership with CU Denver’s School of Education and Human Development and Clayton Early Learning. The program prepares and credentials educational leaders for various early childhood education and care settings that serve all children and families, including those with language, culture and racial diversity, and ability differences.
CU Denver recently received three grants from the Daniels Fund. A grant of $75,000 will support the pilot of an innovative professional development program designed to develop the early childhood education workforce in Colorado. The program, which offers a “micro credentialing” model of online mini courses, is a collaboration between CU Denver, the University of Denver and Qualistar. A second grant of $45,000 over two years will support scholarships for students in CU Denver’s Early Childhood Education program, while a third grant of $45,000 over two years will support scholarships for veterans, adult learners, GED recipients and students from the juvenile justice or foster care systems.

UCCS

The Roberto Saldana Empowerment Endowed Scholarship Fund was created by Roberto Saldana to provide scholarship awards to students who demonstrate an enduring commitment to bettering their lives, contributing to society and making a difference in their communities through education. Saldana established the endowment with an outright gift of $50,000, later to be supported by an estate gift of $130,000.
The UCCS Aging Center is the recipient of grant funding that will assist older adults and their caregivers throughout the region. These partners include the: Inasmuch Foundation, giving $500,000 to establish the Barbara Yalich Endowed Director Fund; Next 50 Initiative, giving $568,182 to support work to connect at-risk seniors with mental health services through collaboration with a variety of community organizations; and the Colorado Springs Health Foundation giving $75,000 to increase access to those with the greatest need without regard to their ability to pay.
Dr. Allen Schoffstall has been part of the UCCS community for more than 50 years as a chemistry department faculty member since 1967. He worked as a soccer official for many years, and has enjoyed watching the UCCS soccer programs improve over the years. Last year, he witnessed the women’s soccer team making their run to the NCAA Final Four, and it inspired him to make a significant gift. The newly created Schoffstall Family Endowment will support scholarships for the men’s and women’s soccer programs at UCCS.

"Tree planted in Gallogly family's honor at UCCS","CU Foundation trustees honored Jim Gallogly during the spring 2018 meeting at UCCS. Jim is taking leave of his roles as a director and trustee of the CU Foundation as he prepares to assume the presidency of the University of Oklahoma this summer.
Trustees planted an evergreen tree in honor of the Gallogly family. Jim’s impromptu remarks at the tree planting—about the power of saying yes to unexpected opportunities—demonstrated his wisdom and grace and why his Foundation and CU colleagues so value his counsel.

"Heritage Society welcomes 140 new members at annual luncheon","Two couples, and the surgeon who performed a life-saving transplant that united them, received a hero’s welcome at the annual University of Colorado Heritage Society Luncheon at the Denver Country Club on June 1.
Teri and Charlie Trafton and Char and Lee Snyder, as well as Peter Kennealey, MD, were given standing ovations for their compelling story of generosity, sacrifice and friendship. Watch the video >>
In 2017, Teri Trafton donated a healthy kidney to Char Snyder, who was suffering from end-stage renal disease; the transplant saved her life. The two couples had met through Colorado Buffs football and were seated next to each other in Section 569 for years.
Vice President for Advancement Johnnie Ray said that while the day’s honored guests were brought together by CU, this same sense of community also united the members of the CU Heritage Society.
“Even though we come from different backgrounds, perspectives and experiences, we are not here by happenstance,” Ray told the audience. “We are seated here today, together, united in a shared vision of what the University of Colorado can do in the world.”
The Traftons and Snyders are donors to CU and Heritage Society members. Months after the successful transplant, the Snyders established the Trafton-Snyder Endowed Fund in Kidney Transplantation.
CU President Bruce Benson, as well as representatives from CU leadership, also attended the event. Now in his 10th year as president, Benson told the crowd that the culture of CU is the result of respect and collaboration. He also gave updates on the university’s reputation, record enrollment numbers, and recent campus initiatives to address the issues of mental health and cybersecurity.   
The University of Colorado Heritage Society honors those who have made a gift to support the University of Colorado through their estate plans. The Heritage Society has more than 1,200 members, with 140 new members inducted this year.
Nearly $160 million has come to CU through estate gifts over the years. Planned gifts help strengthen CU’s academic programs, attract world-class faculty, fuel innovative research, advance healthcare, and support CU students on every campus in every discipline.
For more information about making a planned gift to support CU, call 303-541-1229 or visit cu.planmygift.org.

Financial Updates | Upcoming Meetings | Campus News and Fundraising Highlights
Welcome to the DashBOARD, our quarterly newsletter for CU Foundation trustees.
What a privilege it was to spend time in conversation with so many of you during our visit to the UCCS campus last month. We had a record turnout of trustees for our spring meeting in Colorado Springs. We appreciate all of the hospitality offered to us by Chancellor Venkat Reddy and his leadership team.
The Thursday night dinner for trustees on the stage of the Shockley-Zalabak Theatre kicked off an evening that included dance and drama performances and the opening night of a visually stunning contemporary art exhibit. We were grateful for the opportunity to experience the vibrancy of the Ent Center, one of Colorado’s newest and most spectacular performing arts venues. See photos of dinner on the stage and of the performances.
Our Friday morning program included a presentation by UCCS College of Education Dean Valerie Martin-Conley, Dr. Joe Wehrman, Counseling and Human Services Department Chair, and a panel of their partners in the Campus Connections mentoring program that pairs UCCS students with high school youth. We were all moved by the stories of the positive impacts that emerge when UCCS student mentors work in a group setting with local youth mentees to provide academic support and career planning, encourage positive social skills development, assist with goal setting and implement wellness programs.
Our trustee gathering on May 4 concluded with a tribute to trustee Jim Gallogly. Jim is taking leave of his roles as a director and trustee of the CU Foundation as he prepares to assume the presidency of the University of Oklahoma this summer. Chancellor Reddy and Foundation Board Chair Margaret Bathgate thanked Jim for all of the ways that he has contributed his time and talents to CU. We then planted an evergreen tree in honor of the Gallogly family. Jim’s impromptu remarks at the tree planting—about the power of saying yes to unexpected opportunities—demonstrated his wisdom and grace and why his Foundation and CU colleagues so value his counsel. See photos from the tree planting.
In May, we also said goodbye to our esteemed colleague Andrea Wagner. Andrea retired as Vice Chancellor for Advancement at CU Denver, a position she held for three very productive years. Read more about Andrea's success at CU Denver. Johnnie Ray, Scott Arthur, Deb Coffin, Martin Wood and I will sorely miss Andrea’s thoughtful and insightful perspectives on the joys and the challenges of fundraising for CU.
I look forward to seeing you all in August during our visit to the CU Denver campus. It will be an opportunity to experience the newly opened Lola & Rob Salazar Student Wellness Center, a project that has been in development for several years.

Campus Private Support Highlights for January-March 2018
CU Anschutz

Anne Carr made a $1 million estate commitment to support the Division of Medical Oncology. This gift fuels innovative research in pancreatic cancer, helping researchers develop new patient therapies.
Longtime CU supporter Stan Dempsey gave $200,000 to the Dempsey Neurology Fund. This gift supports the Neurology Supportive and Palliative Care Program, ensuring individuals with neurodegenerative diseases have access to the best care available.
Peter and Sandy Keller gave two gifts totaling more than $460,000 to the Waterman Family Endowed Chair and the Igal Kam, MD, Endowed Chair in Transplant Surgery. Their longstanding support for these endowments provides funds for lectureships and research in liver and digestive diseases as well as transplant surgery.
Ed and Susie Orr recently made a $2 million commitment to establish the Orr Family Endowed Chair. This endowment supports research at the Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, ensuring individuals with type 1 diabetes have access to world-class care.
The School of Medicine has launched an initiative that is designed to encourage giving to new or existing endowed funds. The School of Medicine Acceleration Program allows donors to make gifts to endowed funds and unlock resources today. To do that, the school will contribute the estimated endowment distribution during the first five years of a gift or pledge while the endowed fund grows in value. Endowment gifts from $100,000 to $2 million are eligible for the School of Medicine Acceleration Program. Those gifts must be dedicated to one of four campus goals: advancing discovery by bringing life-changing treatments into practice; transforming patient care by fostering person-centered health and well-being; driving innovation by building a hub of creativity and entrepreneurship; and training future leaders by educating tomorrow’s health care workforce.

CU Boulder

With a gift of $210,000, Barry and Sue Baer have established an endowed scholarship for CU Boulder Army ROTC students along with Barry’s testamentary gift agreement that will support veteran scholarships through the Office of Veteran Services. Barry, a retired colonel, graduated from Army ROTC while an undergraduate student at the university. He is also involved with CU Boulder’s Golden Buffalo Battalion’s Alumni Board of Advisors and the A&S College Advisory Board. Sue is a member of the College of Music Advisory Board.
In support of a building expansion and enhanced collaboration between CU Boulder’s Leeds School of Business and College of Engineering and Applied Science, Foundation trustee Alan Olson (’62) and his wife Carol-Ann (’64) committed to a $1 million gift that will name the entrance space of the new collaborative building. Also in support of the expansion, Zayo founder and CEO Dan Caruso and his wife, Cindy, gave $2 million to support entrepreneurial activities and the future building connection, including a space named the “Caruso Connection.” The expansion will offer collaborative spaces to expand experiential learning opportunities for all business and engineering students at CU Boulder.
Emboldened by their own college experience, CU Boulder alumni and competitive runners Sara (’09) and Brent (’08) Vaughn have established the Vaughn Family Endowed Child Care Scholarship Fund to help fill the financial assistance gap that exists for student-parents. When the couple had their first child, both were full-time students and on athletic scholarships, which they managed to juggle with parenthood. Since graduating, the Vaughns have both competed professionally in running and now wish to help other student-parents realize their dreams. Their gift includes $10,000 in funding for the next five years, half for current-student use and half for an endowment. They hope that others will contribute to the fund and that it will raise much-needed awareness and financial support for college student-parents.

CU Denver

Andrea Wagner stepped down from her position as Vice Chancellor of Advancement on May 18. Andrea joined CU Denver in 2010 as director of development for the Business School and was promoted to lead the Office of Advancement in 2015. Under Andrea’s direction, CU Denver’s Advancement team has grown in size, impact and success while setting annual fundraising records for the campus. Andrea was directly involved with the three largest gifts the campus has received, including the first to name a CU Denver building, and she was instrumental in initiating CU Denver’s first scholarship campaign, which is currently in progress. Melisa Baldwin has been selected as CU Denver's new Vice Chancellor of Advancement. She will start August 1. She comes to CU Denver from Kennesaw State University in Atlanta where she serves as the associate vice president for advancement, development and alumni affairs.
Steven Schuster, who earned his master’s degree in Design and Planning at CU, and his wife, Mary Anne Howard, recently established a bequest to support scholarships for students in the College of Architecture and Planning. Currently valued at $500,000, the bequest is intended to help the college recruit the best and brightest students in the field of architecture. Mr. Schuster lives in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he is founding principal of Clearscapes, an architectural design firm responsible for a number of public and private projects across North Caroline, including the Exploris Museum, Raleigh Convention Center and Contemporary Art Museum of Raleigh.

UCCS

Through a planned gift, Barbara and Alan Steiner will add to an endowment to ultimately support two Chancellor’s Leadership Class scholars each year. The Steiners, who join CU’s Heritage Society with their gift, have been committed CLC donors and champions since the inception of the program. The CLC engages scholars with the members of the Colorado Springs community to nourish positive community impact through leadership and training. The Steiners have a passion for leadership; Alan’s former leadership role with Hewlett/Packard connected him to UCCS. Their gift follows many years of making annual gifts to the program.
The Norwood Foundation is a long-time supporter of the Bruce and Anne Shepard Reach Your Peak Scholarship Program at UCCS. Norwood recently made a $25,000 gift to support the scholarship program. This year, the community-funded program will graduate 33 scholars, and the graduation rate for the program is 93 percent. Currently, all gifts to the program are matched one to one by the Colorado Opportunity Scholarship Initiative.
Andy Cain, who recently joined the Penrose St. Francis Health Services Board of Trustees, made a $10,000 gift to UCCS’ Public Safety Initiative to support the McConkie Leadership Conference. The annual conference provides leaders in governments and nonprofits with leadership training and best practices. This year more than 150 attendees learned about leading under stress and preparing to lead at a higher level within their departments.

Dear colleagues,
Welcome to the winter edition of DashBOARD, our quarterly newsletter for CU Foundation trustees.
Those of us who attended the winter gathering of trustees at CU's Anschutz Medical Campus in mid-February are still talking about what we learned about the critically important research and clinical work being done by our faculty and staff there. Indeed, through them, our university is thoughtfully addressing some of society's gravest medical challenges.
On Thursday evening, our conversation focused on America's new epidemic - addiction and opioids. We heard from Dr. Joe Sakai, associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry, about his lab's goal to improve the neuroscientific understanding of addiction in hopes of developing more effective treatments. And Dr. Robert Valuck, professor in the Departments of Clinical Pharmacy, Epidemiology and Family Medicine, spoke to us about the work of the Colorado Consortium for Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention, a task force he chairs to address our prescription drug abuse problem with a collaborative, state-wide approach.
On Friday morning, Chancellor Don Elliman explained to us why and how the Anschutz Medical Campus is making a substantial investment in exploring the causes of and effective treatments for mental health diseases. Dr. Frank DeGruy, Woodward Chisholm Professor and chair of the Department of Family Medicine, shared his insights and passion for integrating mental health care with primary care treatments. Then Heather Mulvihill, CU Foundation trustee and board chair of the Helen and Arthur E. Johnson Depression Center, moderated a panel on current topics related to mental health care. Panelists included Dr. Marshall Thomas, executive director of the Johnson Depression Center, Jay Voight, a physician at the Center for Dependency, Addiction and Rehabilitation (CeDAR), and Spencer Milo, a retired U.S. Army staff sergeant and Director of Veteran Programs, Communications and Strategic Development at the Marcus Institute for Brain Health, which opened on the campus just last year.
The Anschutz Medical Campus's success in attracting top talent and the faculty's ensuing research and clinical accomplishments are made possible by your generous philanthropic support. I am pleased to share with you that during calendar year 2017 the CU Foundation's trustees collectively gave more than $7.5 million to fund the university's mission, a new record level of annual giving by the trustees as a group.
I look forward to seeing you all in early May during our visit to the UCCS campus in Colorado Springs. It will be an opportunity to experience the newly opened Ent Center for the Arts, the multi-venue facility we toured under construction last year.

CU Denver

In December 2017, the University of Colorado Denver announced a $10 million gift that establishes the campus’s first named building, the Lola & Rob Salazar Student Wellness Center. The Salazar Family Foundation pledged its largest-ever single donation to support this new facility in the heart of CU Denver’s vibrant downtown campus, enriching community, connection and student life. Opening in spring 2018, the Lola & Rob Salazar Student Wellness Center will be an 85,000 square-foot facility featuring a climbing wall, three-court gymnasium, six-lane pool, weight room, fitness studios, reflection rooms and an outdoor adventure center. Designed to promote multiple dimensions of student health and wellness, the center offers programs and activities that address students’ social, physical, emotional and spiritual well-being.
“Through our gift and through our story, we hope to be role models for students on the CU Denver campus as people they can relate to achieving success in life. We want the Lola & Rob Salazar Student Wellness Center to inspire young people to make their dreams come true through hard work and an education,” said Lola Salazar, who attended CU Denver for a master’s degree in Education. Rob Salazar added, “We want young people to see that they’re no different from us. If we can do it, it’s achievable.”
Building upon their current generous support for international initiatives and the Colorado Building Workshop at the College of Architecture and Planning, Don and Maria Johnson have designated the establishment of the Bixler Honors Program as a beneficiary of their estate. The program will promote international relations and opportunities for students to become global thought leaders in the built environment and experiential learning. It is also intended to bring together high-performing students, faculty and practitioners from leading international design cultures such as Finland, Italy, Japan and America to study architecture and the process of its realization and to increase appreciation of other cultures, design ideas and construction methods.
At the same time, the Johnsons have established a new $200,000 endowment to provide travel awards to master’s of Architecture students at the University of Colorado Denver. These awards will encourage students to explore significant contributions to the field of architecture globally. Recipients will be top-ranked students with high academic merit and will be selected by the College of Architecture and Planning. Don Johnson was a CU Trustee from 2010-2016.

Following a presentation Chancellor Venkat Reddy made to the community, Greg Ireton, a community member in attendance, decided to make a blended gift to UCCS totaling $1.05 million. A portion of the gift was made through a stock transfer, and the remainder was made through a bequest. Ireton’s gift is being used to create a scholarship to provide support for students, who without financial aid would not be able to attend college.
Darwin Horan made a $1 million commitment to the UCCS Track and Field Facility currently being developed on the North Nevada corridor. The gift will support the construction of the facility as well as equipment for the track and field team.

"Want to be more engaged as a trustee? Here are ways to get more involved","By Carol Frank
As the chair of the CU Foundation’s Trustee Engagement Committee, I am often asked by fellow trustees how they can get more involved. Of course, we would not be trustees if we were not already involved with CU. And yet there is no question that we are a group that wants to do more! Here are some ideas and stories from fellow trustees that we hope you will find helpful and inspiring.
Find an area of CU you are passionate about and host an event to increase awareness
Trustee Kathy Finley has taken this concept to a whole new level! Over the last several years, Kathy has hosted multiple events for a variety of CU-related causes. These events are designed to increase awareness of the particular cause and (hopefully) these causes will inspire new donors. Examples of events Kathy has hosted are:

Kathy and trustee Dawn Wood co-hosted ""CU at Lunch"" for 30 of their friends at the Denver Country Club. The lunch featured a faculty member from the CU Anschutz Medical Campus.
Kathy hosted a donor lunch in Palm Desert in coordination with the ""CU in the Desert"" weekend for CU Boulder.
Kathy hosted a cocktail party in her home for the Boots to Suits program and inspired donors to give $13,000 to this organization that helps veterans transition from CU Denver to the business world.
This year Kathy, Heidi Ganahl and I co-hosted an event in Kathy’s home for Canines Providing Assistance to Wounded Warriors (C-P.A.W.W.). We had about 75 people attend and it was a hugely successful event.
Kathy is now working on taking 20 women out to the Depression Center at CU Anschutz to hear speakers, learn about the services offered and meet with Heather Mulvihill, the center’s board chair and new trustee.

In October, I hosted an event at my home for about 30 guests designed to create awareness around the leading-edge work that CU Anschutz is doing in the field of breast cancer. Our speaker was Dr. Virginia Borges, a world-renowned expert in breast cancer in young women. I did not tout this as a fundraiser, nor did we ask for money at the event. Instead we advertised this as an opportunity to ""learn more about this important work being done at CU Anschutz.""
The event was wildly successful and resulted in multiple requests for tours of the CU Anschutz campus from attendees who would like to learn more.
Mentor a new trustee
Your first several trustee meetings can be overwhelming as you meet many new people and learn the ropes. Dawn Massop Love was a new trustee last year when longtime trustees Marianne Franklin and Fred Bradford took her under their wings. Here’s how Dawn describes her experience as a new trustee:
Outstanding and overwhelming—Being in a room of such renowned people, who would I talk to? Thankfully my mentor Marianne Franklin had reached out before my first meeting and then I had an assigned table to head to. There I met Fred Bradford who was the table captain and he offered to answer any questions for me. Fred has made a point to greet me at every meeting and wherever I have run into him since. He takes the time to introduce me to other board members and truly made me feel welcomed. I strive to do the same for others, introducing them to each other. What an amazing group of people, what great information we receive and now I have such a great perspective to share with others about all that is happening behind the scenes at the various campuses. In fact, I was able to direct a recent friend to UCCS as an option for her son.
Take an alum to a CU Advocate event
One of the ways trustee Win Johnson and his wife, Cinda, have become more engaged is to take alumni to CU Advocate programs in Boulder. It is a nice way to introduce friends and potential donors to CU faculty and students, and learn about all the innovations occurring on the various campuses. If you are not already a CU Advocate or wish to update your mailing information, fill out this form.
Engage with your favorite school… and ask questions!
Andrew Larson, a trustee since 2016, is the poster child for finding passion and engagement within CU. I asked Andrew to share his story:
As a trustee of one year, I had been wondering how I could get more involved and engaged with CU. My main passion is to support our Larson Building Systems Lab at the College of Engineering & Applied Science. So, I recently dropped off a check to Bobby Braun, the college’s dean, to support both the endowment for the lab and for scholarships for students who go through the lab. But to get even more engaged, I recently started asking more questions. Initially, I started collecting alumni information from other schools my wife and I have attended (Northwestern University, University of Penn and USC) to share best practices with alumni reunions and direct mail. I recently met with Dean Braun for lunch and we discussed how we could move the Larson Lab forward to both attract more students, attract more funding and to help the students to find internships and jobs after graduation. With an interest in BioFrontiers, I met with development officer Hilary Furlong to understand better all the amazing things they are doing there. I have a next meeting with Vice Chancellor Terri Fiez to deepen my understanding, and learn how I may help at BioFrontiers. Also, at the last trustee meeting, we heard some of the amazing work that Eve-Lyn Hinckley is doing in Environmental Studies working in Napa and Sonoma Valley to better understand the effects of sulfur in the vineyards and the surrounding ecosystem. As a vineyard owner, after her presentation, I offered to put her in touch with our third-party vineyard manager, who works with 50 different vineyards, with the hope that she could do her research across a much broader set of vineyards than she currently does. What a small world this is!
Additionally, I believe that one of our roles as trustees is to make sure that we help to find great students for CU and especially ones where their family can also help support our great institutions. So, I have worked with Jack and Barb to track (with Admissions) a few students whose grades, test scores and accomplishments are noteworthy, and also who have CU as their first choice. Although no promises are made from Admissions, I'm hopeful that if this student is equally qualified and CU is their first choice, that with a trustee tracking their application, this will be a tiebreaker for Admissions to help this student get in, and also to help their family to think of CU with their plans for giving.
At our upcoming February meeting on the CU Anschutz campus, members of the Trustee Engagement Committee will have on special name tags and will also speak to the group about ways you can become involved and make even more of a difference on behalf of our beloved CU.
Carol Frank is the chair of the Trustee Engagement Committee and a Managing Director at MHT Partners Investment Bank.

Financial Updates | Upcoming Meetings | Campus News and Fundraising Highlights
Dear colleagues,
Thanks to all of you who joined the celebration of the CU Foundation’s 50th anniversary during the fall weekend gathering of trustees at CU Boulder. Your enthusiastic participation together with former trustees and university leadership made for a festive evening. Read 50 years of CU Foundation milestones here.
It is a happy coincidence that CU Boulder’s mascot Ralphie also is celebrating her 50th birthday this year. Everyone in attendance at the anniversary party enjoyed former board chair (and former Ralphie handler) Glenn Porzak’s stories about how CU Boulder’s mascot came to be.
At the trustees gathering on November 10, we heard updates from CU President Bruce Benson and from Foundation leadership, including a report on the positive investment performance of the Foundation’s $1.563 billion Long Term Investment Pool. Trustees received a copy of the Foundation’s latest Annual Report to Investors, which is also available on our website.
Chancellor Phil DiStefano shared news of progress being made on key initiatives on the CU Boulder campus. Our morning at the Folsom Stadium Club concluded with engaging presentations by three outstanding faculty members—Sarah Krakoff, Eve-Lyn Hinckley and Jason Neff—each of whom shared perspectives on their work in the areas of water law, environmental studies and agricultural sustainability. Trustees then had the opportunity to go deeper with these faculty members in table conversations over lunch.
The fall trustees meeting is always a time of transition for the CU Foundation’s volunteer leadership. We welcomed 20 new trustees—CU supporters from across the country who have already shown their dedication to the university’s mission through the investment of their time, talents and treasure in CU. The new trustees participated in an orientation session where they learned about their role in CU Advancement and were welcomed by Board Chair Margaret Bathgate, President Benson, Trustee Leslie Stratton, Vice President for Advancement Johnnie Ray, the CU Anschutz Medical Campus’ Vice Chancellor for Advancement Scott Arthur and me. Read more about the role trustees play in CU Advancement. To remind us all about the important role trustees play in advancing our mission, this issue of the DashBOARD includes an article written by Carol Frank. It is a collection of inspiring stories about the many ways trustees engage with and advocate for CU.
Trustees Agneta Albinsson, Mike Fryt, Becky Medved and Melinda Yee began their terms as members of the Foundation’s board of directors earlier this month. Agneta and her husband, Mats, are volunteers and philanthropic leaders on the CU Anschutz Medical Campus. Melinda, a partner at Deloitte based in Houston, serves on the alumni and friends board of the Leeds School of Business. Mike and Becky each earned degrees at both UCCS and CU Boulder. Mike is a retired tax lawyer who still volunteers his time working on federal tax policy from his base in Tennessee. Becky and her husband, John, who is also a trustee, are community leaders in Colorado Springs and champions of many different schools and programs at UCCS. Agneta and Becky will continue to serve on the board’s membership committee, and Melinda and Mike will join the board’s audit committee.
As we come to the end of the calendar year wherein we celebrated the Foundation’s 50th birthday, I am mindful of the many alumni and friends of CU who have served the Foundation so well and faithfully over the decades. I am grateful too for the wise and dedicated volunteers who currently lead the Foundation’s governing board. Margaret Bathgate, chair, Mike Imhoff, vice chair, and committee chairs Barry Amman, Marcia Pryde, Dave Baker, Eric Kramer and Mary Sissel all will continue to serve in these roles in the year ahead. And Carol Frank’s enthusiastic leadership of the trustee engagement team is so appreciated. We on the staff of the Foundation could not do our work without their guidance and support. Thank you!
As we remember and commemorate the accomplishments of the past 50 years, we rededicate ourselves to the mission of the University of Colorado. We have great expectations for how the CU Foundation will serve CU in the years ahead as a steward of donors, a champion of philanthropy and a partner in growing CU’s endowment.
With thanksgiving for all you do for the University of Colorado and the CU Foundation,

Jack Finlaw

Michael Lilly made a $2 million commitment through his estate plans to establish the Lilly Family Endowed Scholarship for undergraduate students.

In support of the arts, Mark and Polly Addison made a recent commitment of $50,000 to the acquisition of The Sharkive. The collection is a treasure that embodies the strength and vitality of the arts today.

In honor of her gift, the kitchen at the new center, which will open in spring 2018, will be named the Posner Family Kitchen.

Financial Updates | Upcoming Meetings | Campus News and Fundraising Highlights
Dear colleagues,
Welcome to the summer edition of DashBOARD, our quarterly newsletter for CU Foundation trustees.
We are celebrating a successful year as we close out our books on fiscal year 2017 – a year that produced outstanding investment returns and a record breaking amount of philanthropic gifts given to CU through the Foundation.
As of June 30, 2017, the University’s 2,635 endowments managed by the Foundation were valued at $1.22 billion, the total value of the Foundation’s long term investment pool was $1.52 billion and the Foundation’s total assets were $1.89 billion. The LTIP’s investment performance was 15% for the year ended June 30. See investment performance details.
Gifts received by the Foundation for the benefit of CU totaled $187 million in fiscal year 2017, or $9 million more than in fiscal year 2016. Kudos to our partners at CU Advancement who do such a good job connecting donors with their passions! See total private support figures.
We are also celebrating the creation of the new Benson Society. Earlier this summer, the Foundation’s board of directors established a giving society for donors with cumulative university-wide giving of $1 million or more and resolved that this new giving society will be called the “Benson Society” in honor of the many contributions that Bruce and Marcy Benson have made to the University of Colorado. Read our news release about the Benson Society.
And we are celebrating the accomplishments of two long time trustees and directors as they complete their service on the Foundation’s board of directors. Fred Bradford and Ed Osborne have been outstanding board leaders and we are pleased to be able to recognize their years of loyal service. Read more about their accomplishments.
I look forward to seeing you all at our next board of trustees meeting in Boulder in November. This fall we will welcome an enthusiastic group of 20 new trustees as we gather to savor the many delights of a fall weekend at CU Boulder.
Best regards,

Jack Finlaw
President and CEO

Fred Bradford and Ed Osborne – Thanks for your service to the CU Foundation
Two outstanding volunteers are retiring from the Foundation’s board of directors after six years of service. (Ed previously served a two-year stint on the board in the early 2000s when his expertise was needed on the Audit Committee.) The good news is that both Ed and Fred will continue to serve as Foundation trustees.
Fred brought his wisdom and legal expertise to the deliberations of the board. He also brought his passion for CU’s athletics programs. Fred has been a dedicated supporter of CU Boulder’s athletic department for over 28 years. Through the Bradford scholarship endowment, Fred and his wife Lawren provide scholarship support to student athletes in the CU Boulder football program. Hugh Charles, Rodney Stewart, Blake Behrens, Christian Powers and current recipient Ronnie Blackmon are among the many student athletes who have benefitted from a Bradford scholarship. Fred is also a fan of the men’s basketball program for which he has held season tickets for the past ten years, and he has supported other athletic programs such as lacrosse and golf. His fellow directors will long remember Fred’s wit and sage advice.
A long time member and chair of the board’s Audit Committee, Ed has played a key role in reviewing and improving the Foundation’s annual audited financial statements, tax returns, donor compliance programs and risk mitigation efforts. Ed and his wife Mary have made CU a philanthropic priority, serving as the UCCS chairs for the Creating Futures campaign. And their many financial contributions have been matched by their generosity of spirit and their sharing of their time and talents with UCCS faculty and students. Ed has served on the UCCS College of Engineering and Applied Science Advisory Board, where he has given particular support to the Senior Design Project, a judged student engineering competition. Ed led the effort to construct the Center for Science and Engineering at UCCS. This facility, now named for Ed and Mary, nearly doubled the academic and research space available for the study of engineering and science at UCCS. Ed has served on the Reach Your Peak Scholarship community board, adding his guidance to its programming and fundraising efforts to support first generation college students. In 2016, Ed and Mary each were honored by the UCCS College of Business with its Lifetime Entrepreneur Award. And their love for the theater and other performing arts led Ed and Mary to contribute to and help fundraise for the new Ent Center for the Arts at UCCS, which includes the new Osborne Theater. Ed’s experience and passion for CU will be missed by his fellow directors.
All of us at CU are grateful for the extraordinary generosity and outstanding service of these two fine gentlemen.

Financial Updates | Investment Policy Committee | Upcoming Meetings | Campus News and Fundraising Highlights
Welcome to the spring edition of DashBOARD, our quarterly newsletter for CU Foundation Trustees.
This spring we are celebrating the CU Foundation’s 50th anniversary. For five decades the Foundation has served the philanthropic needs of the University of Colorado. The Foundation was formed in April 1967 by a group of dedicated alumni and community leaders who came together around a vision to raise private support for the university. While our organizational structure has evolved over the years, we have never lost our focus on promoting the university and encouraging philanthropic giving in support of its mission. Stay tuned for details about an anniversary reunion party we are planning for volunteer board members past and present to be held at CU Boulder in November.
We have launched an updated CU Foundation website just in time for our 50th birthday. Follow this link to visit our spiffy new landing page. There you will see our Mission, Vision and Values Statement and quick links to our annual report, our audited financial statements and other financial and investment documents, including our recently updated Endowment Spending Policy. You will also find information about our volunteer leadership, board committees and staff.
Those of you who were with us earlier this month in Colorado Springs experienced first-hand the growth and vitality of UCCS. From the “hard hat” tour of the new Ent Center for the Performing Arts to the presentation by campus leaders responsible for programming the new Hybl Sports Medicine and Performance Center, we were presented with a stimulating series of opportunities to learn more about how UCCS is finding new ways to serve both students and the greater Colorado Springs community. And we were inspired by Ed Osborne’s appeal for support of the Reach Your Peak Scholarship program and scholarship recipient Mykinthia Ebron’s heartwarming speech.
All of us at the CU Foundation extend our warm congratulations to Venkat Reddy, who earlier this week was appointed by President Benson as Chancellor of UCCS. We are grateful for the gracious hospitality provided to us by Chancellor Reddy, Vice Chancellor Martin Wood and their team members during our visit to Southern Colorado’s great public university.
I look forward to seeing you all at our next trustee gatherings on August 17 and 18 at CU Denver.
Best regards,
Jack Finlaw

Sie Foundation provided a generous $2 million gift to the University of Colorado BioFrontiers Institute to fund a 7,050 square-foot research neighborhood, as part of the fifth-wing expansion of the Jennie Smoly Caruthers Biotechnology Building. Named in honor of John J. Sie’s mother, the Yuan Yung-Foo Interdisciplinary Bioscience Research Neighborhood will provide the opportunity for additional scientists, faculty and students to collaborate in the BioFrontiers Institute’s world-class research facilities as they embark on scientific discovery into many of the world’s most challenging health issues.
With strong support from campus, the Leeds School of Business and the College of Engineering and Applied Science are partnering for a 30,000 square-foot expansion to bridge the two disciplines. The opportunity offers creative, collaborative and connective spaces to expand experiential learning opportunities for all business and engineering students. This space will foster innovative problem-solving to produce a new generation of leaders who possess the connections, education and entrepreneurial ingenuity to shape the future.
Thanks to family, friends and real estate icons, the Sherman R. Miller Endowed Executive Directorship surpassed $2.5 million and will have a lasting impact for the CU Real Estate Center’s students and for Sherm’s legacy.
Becky Roser, a longtime College of Music supporter and former chair of the Music Advisory Board, recently created a $2 million endowment, naming the keyboard area the Roser Piano and Keyboard Program. Becky now chairs the music+ campaign committee and is helping to kick off the $50 million fundraising efforts of the new campaign. Her gift is inspired by her lifetime love of piano, and will inspire others to contribute as well. Read the full story.

Gift from Daniels Fund Brings Attention to Fake News
The Terrace Room at the Lawrence Street Center was filled to capacity on Thursday, March 30, to hear about “Fake News and Filter Bubbles” in the second installment of the Daniels Fund Colloquia on Ethics in Communication, presented by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. More than 200 attended this keynote event, made possible with a $250,000 grant from the Daniels Fund that supports principle-based education in journalism through six events over a two-year period.
Panelists addressed challenges to the integrity of news reporting. They included Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Hedrick Smith, a former New York Times reporter and editor and a current producer and correspondent for the PBS’ Frontline; Dr. Ashley Muddiman, Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Kansas, who specializes in political media, particularly online; and Alexios Mantzarlis, founder of the International Fact-Checking Network at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies.
Molly Hughes, the Emmy award-winning journalist and the director of Denver Post TV, moderated.
Faculty and staff visit Qatar and Saudi Arabia
During the week of March 20, a team from CU visited Qatar and Saudi Arabia to strengthen relationships with two countries that send CU Denver many students. Representing CU were President Bruce and Marcy Benson; Chancellor Dorothy Horrell; Kat Vlahos, Professor, Department Chair, and Director, Center of Preservation Research for the College of Architecture and Planning (CoPR); John Sunnygard, Executive Director, Office of International Affairs; Andrea Wagner, Vice Chancellor of Advancement; and Noelle DeLage, Assistant Vice Chancellor of Advancement.
In addition to gathering with alumni in the region, the team met in Qatar with Prime Minister Abdullah Bin Nasser Bin Khalifa Al Thani, whose son graduated from CU Denver’s Business School last May; Dr. Rachel Hajar, a physician at the Heart Hospital in Doha whose endowment gift to the CU School of Medicine established the Hajar Al Binali International Visiting Scholar Program in Cardiology; and Dr. Hajar (’69, MD ’73), who serves as Qatar’s Undersecretary for Health.
In Riyadh, the group was honored to have an audience with HRH Prince Sultan bin Salman, President and Chairman of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage. The commission is interested in partnering with CoPR to document and develop built heritage sites in Saudi Arabia for tourism. The host in Jeddah was Zuhair Fayez, (’71), chairman of the largest architectural/engineering/management firm in Saudi Arabia and founder of CU Denver’s architecture exchange program with Dar Al-Hekma University in Jeddah.
Chancellor Horrell noted both countries demand a commitment to excellence in everything they do: “This is part of our effort to say our doors and hearts are open to international students and partnerships.”

UCCS

UCCS professor Al Schoffstall made a planned gift commitment of $500,000 to the chemistry and biochemistry department. The contributions will further research and scholarships at UCCS. 
The Marie Walsh Sharpe Foundation gave $75,000 to the UCCS public sculpture fund to support temporary, rotating sculptural projects shown on the grounds of the new Ent Center for the Arts sculpture garden.
Jeff Flygare has made a planned gift of $1,167,020 to UCCS Theatreworks.

UCCS will name a new main stage theater after Chancellor Emerita Pam Shockley-Zalabak following the completion of a $1.5 million fundraising campaign that was spearheaded by CU Regent Kyle Hybl and his wife, Sally. Read more.
UCCS announced it will name an under-development sports medicine and performance center The William J. Hybl Sports Medicine and Performance Center. The naming reflects the longtime support of the El Pomar Foundation as well as its specific support for the university’s efforts to redevelop North Nevada Avenue, where the new building will be.

"Giving amplifies a vibrant future for CU, Benson tells donors","Donors propel CU forward because they invest in a university that lifts local communities, Colorado and the world.
CU President Bruce Benson told donors at an April 28 Heritage Society luncheon that their generosity and passion are increasingly important partners in assuring CU transforms lives.
“Thank you for what you do for this university,” Benson said. “It’s a great university because of our people—all of our donors and friends who support CU.”
Nearly 240 members of the Heritage Society—donors who commit to providing future gifts through their estates—gathered at the Denver Botanic Gardens to learn how their philanthropy seeds important pursuits like health care research, student-body diversity, scholarships, the expansion of online education and more.
CU welcomed 113 new Heritage Society members this year, increasing its membership to more than 1,300.
Doug and Mary Ann Looney—donors who support scholarships for student-athletes in men’s basketball at CU Boulder—said they feel an obligation to give because CU has given them so much.
“We don’t owe this place a lot. We owe it everything,” Doug (’63) said, noting CU’s role in many of their milestones: meeting each other in freshman English, getting married as seniors, his journalism degree and her education degree. “You start thinking about the significant things in your life. And CU was in on most of the major events.”
Mary Ann (’63) said she’s grateful for the opportunities CU still provides, like serving on boards and making new friends, and she sees philanthropy as a natural evolution in their relationship.
“CU is continuing to give to us,” she said.

From left: CU President Bruce Benson, Mary Ann Looney, Doug Looney and UCCS Interim Chancellor Venkat Reddy
Johnnie Ray, vice president for Advancement, said CU’s core purpose is to transform lives, and donors do that by investing through the university.
“Charitable donations are investments in greater societal returns,” he said, “and investing in CU is an investment in the future of the state of Colorado.”
The university stands to benefit from approximately $13 million in future gifts committed since January, in addition to $58 million from 2016. CU began keeping formal records of planned gifts that the university received in 1985; since then, nearly $150 million in estate gifts have benefitted university programs.
Donors have given $302 million in total private support to CU since July 1, the start of the fiscal year.
Future gifts provide one of CU’s most important sources of philanthropy, allowing donors to identify the programs that are personally meaningful while structuring gifts that support their financial goals and the university.

"DashBOARD: Winter 2017","
Financial Updates | Upcoming Meetings | Campus Highlights
Dear colleagues,
Welcome to the winter 2017 edition of DashBOARD, our quarterly newsletter for CU Foundation trustees.
This month the University of Colorado is celebrating the many accomplishments of recently retired Chancellor Pam Shockley-Zalabak. Pam moved from success to success during her long tenure at the helm of UCCS. Those of us who have had the privilege of working with Pam and seeing her in action will miss her passion, her dedication and her integrity, and we wish her well in her future endeavors.
Pam began her career at UCCS in January 1976, teaching communications courses in an unheated trailer at what was then a commuter school. Since that time, Pam has come to preside over the only research university providing master’s and doctoral programs in the southern part of our state. And so much of what has come to pass at UCCS has occurred because of Pam’s vision and tireless efforts to see her strategic plans accomplished.
Here are some highlights of what UCCS has achieved under Pam’s leadership:
UCCS has experienced 75 percent growth in enrollment, from 6,851 students in 2001 to approximately 12,000 students today. And a high percentage of students are ethnic minorities or the first in their families to attend college.
The campus has seen more than $300 million in new construction,  including its largest building, Osborne Science and Engineering, named in honor of trustee Ed Osborne and his wife, Mary, and the first campus building dedicated to the arts, the under-construction $70 million Ent Center for the Arts. The Lane Center for the Academic Health Sciences, which includes a branch campus of the CU School of Medicine, and the planned William J. Hybl Sports Medicine and Performance Center are also located on North Nevada. The Gallogly Recreation and Wellness Center, named in honor of trustee Jim Gallogly’s family, and the Gallogly Events Center, named in memory of Tommy Gallogly, were also added under Pam’s leadership.
UCCS has benefitted from large increases in philanthropic support, including an $8 million endowed gift leading to the naming of the Helen and Arthur E. Johnson Beth-El College of Nursing and Health Sciences, and $10 million in gifts from the Osbornes to support various campus programs. And in 2016 alone, UCCS received $19.5 million in private support.
The campus has become a major economic development driver in Colorado Springs. With an annual operating budget of $228 million, UCCS employs one of every 50 people in El Paso County and generates $450 million in annual economic impact. In 2001, UCCS employed about 860 faculty and staff. Today, UCCS employs 1,624, including 855 faculty and 772 staff.
UCCS has expanded its academic programs. In 2001, UCCS offered 35 bachelor’s programs, 17 master’s programs and one doctoral degree program. It now offers 45 bachelor’s, 22 master’s and five doctoral degree programs. New programs include inclusive elementary education, exercise science, game design and development, computer science and security, professional golf management and sports management as well as doctoral degrees in education, nursing, geropsychology, computer science and mechanical and aerospace engineering. Pam oversaw changes in UCCS’ statutory mission statement to include research and graduate students and implemented two campus-wide strategic plans.
From part-time honorarium instructor in the mid-1970s, Pam moved up the faculty ranks and was named a professor in 1992. She joined the campus central administration in 1994, was named dean of student success in 1996 and became vice chancellor for student success in 1998, a position she held until being named chancellor in 2001. As UCCS chancellor, Pam continued to teach and research. She is the author of nine books and more than 100 articles and productions focusing on organizational communication.
See photos: Campus says farewell to Shockley-Zalabak
Our spring meeting of the Foundation’s Board of Trustees will be at UCCS on May 4 and 5. Our host will be Interim Chancellor Venkat Reddy, whom President Benson tapped to lead UCCS while a search for Pam’s permanent replacement is conducted. Venkat is a well-known and respected campus leader. He began at UCCS as an instructor in 1991 and, through several promotions, became a professor of finance in 2004. Venkat has served as dean of the College of Business since 2005 and vice chancellor for online programs in the Division of Academic Affairs since 2014. We look forward to hearing from him and learning first-hand of the many exciting developments at UCCS during our spring gathering there.
We at the CU Foundation look forward with great expectations to the future successes and growth of UCCS. We appreciate the opportunity to serve this extraordinary campus and its students, faculty and administrators, and especially its advancement professionals, as a partner in philanthropy.
Best regards,
Jack Finlaw
President and CEO
University of Colorado Foundation

CU Boulder

David Pyle made a $1 million endowment gift, of which $500,000 will be used as matching funds to motivate like-minded donors, to support the Visiting Scholar for Conservative Thought & Policy in the College of Arts and Sciences. It will support the goal of the Center for Western Civilization, Thought & Policy to bring diverse voices to university conversations, and foster research, debate and dialogue on the fundamental ideals of our time.
Lockheed Martin’s $3 million sponsorship will establish academic programs to develop the next generation of space engineers. The programs will focus on radio frequency systems, which are important to commercial, civic and military needs for communication, radar and photonic technology. For students, the partnership means even more opportunities to get experience in tracking, navigation and spacecraft control, and in next-generation global-navigation technology. Read more.
In 2013, Michael Savage (A&S ’92, Law ’96) made pledges to establish the Savage Law Scholarship and the Savage CU in D.C. Scholarship. In December, he worked with Kimberly Bowman (assistant dean for Advancement for Arts & Sciences) and Mary Beth Searles (assistant dean for Advancement at Law) to commit a $1 million estate gift to be divided equally between the two scholarships. Michael is a member of the CU Foundation Trustees and the Colorado Law Alumni Board.
Private support totaling $15 million from Ann Smead and her husband, Michael Byram, will name the Ann and H.J. Smead Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences. It further boosts the campus’ reputation as a leader in aerospace research, education and industry collaboration. Their gift cements the legacy of the Smead Program, established in 2006 to attract and support the nation’s top aerospace engineering doctoral students and rising faculty stars. The program was created to honor H. J. “Joe” Smead, a CU Boulder engineering college alumnus, doctor of electrical engineering, noted industry executive and Ann’s husband prior to his passing in 2003. Read more.

"University of Colorado Foundation","Our Mission
We receive, manage and prudently invest private support for the benefit of the University of Colorado and support the University’s philanthropic endeavors through donor stewardship.

Our Values

About the University of Colorado Foundation
For over 50 years, the University of Colorado Foundation has partnered with the University of Colorado to enhance philanthropic support for CU. Private support for the University, given through the philanthropic portal of the Foundation, enables the University to transform lives through education, research, clinical care and community engagement. See the Annual Report to Investors 2019-20 and the CU Foundation’s Audited Financial Statements for highlights of the Foundation’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2020. See CU Foundation’s Financial and Investment Documents for additional years, fiscal policies and guides.
The Foundation was founded in 1967 by a group of dedicated alumni and community leaders who sought to raise and invest private funding for the University to augment its other revenue streams. The CU Foundation is a legally separate 501(c)(3) charitable organization that functions as a part of CU Advancement.
The Foundation focuses its efforts on donor stewardship through customer service and assurance in gift acceptance, processing and administration. During fiscal year 2020, the Foundation processed 65,811 gifts and commitments. The Foundation invests and allocates gift funds in a manner consistent with the purposes established by donors, and distributes dollars from its managed funds to support a wide variety of programs and activities throughout the University system and on its four campuses.
Financial Highlights
As of Dec. 31, 2020, the Foundation managed more than $2 billion in assets for the benefit of the University of Colorado, including more than 3,000 current fund accounts and more than 3,000 endowment funds. The endowments collectively were valued at $1.8 billion, and the Foundation’s Long Term Investment Pool (the “LTIP”) was valued at $2.2 billion.
For the six months ending Dec. 31, 2020, the LTIP increased in value by 16.74%. The LTIP’s 3-year annualized investment performance was +10.0%, its 7-year performance was +8.6%, its 10-year performance was +8.8%, and its 15-year performance was +8.0%. See the Investment Update for a current report on the LTIP’s recent investment performance.
Governance and Staffing
The Foundation is governed by an elected Board of Directors. Board committees include an Investment Policy Committee, a Finance/Operations Committee and an Audit Committee. See a list of board members and committee chairs.
The Foundation’s day-to-day operations are overseen by Jack Finlaw, its President and CEO, who works with an administrative staff of 20 employees. Read more about the Foundation’s executive team.
The Foundation follows an outsourced chief investment officer model (OCIO) and contracts investment management services through Agility, a private investment management firm. The Foundation’s Investment Policy Committee establishes the investment policy parameters within which the OCIO operates, and monitors the OCIO’s performance with an independent consultant’s assistance.
Operating Budget
The Foundation generates revenue from three primary sources:

an assessment on endowed funds in the LTIP;
a distribution from the Foundation’s short term investment pool;
and a distribution from a board-designated quasi-endowment.

Of the $35 million in revenue budgeted for fiscal year 2021, the Foundation will retain $5 million to fund its operations and transfer $30 million to CU as a contribution towards funding CU Advancement’s operating expenses and IT infrastructure investments.
Endowment Spending Policy
The Foundation’s Board of Directors has established an Endowment Spending Policy that sets the parameters for spending from the endowments the Foundation holds for the University’s benefit. The board is committed to investing and administering all endowment funds in compliance with applicable federal and state laws and industry standards.
The Endowment Spending Policy’s objective is to achieve a balance between the University’s present and future needs. This means balancing the needs of current beneficiaries and the University’s advancement operations, while preserving an endowment’s purchasing power to support future beneficiaries. The policy aims to provide the University with perpetual, growing and consistent revenue and to preserve each endowment’s real value, net of annual distributions and fees.
The Endowment Spending Policy has three components:

a distribution formula
	The annual distribution to a CU program from an endowment is paid on the first day of each fiscal year (July 1) in an amount equal to 4% of the endowment’s trailing 36-month market value as of the prior December 31.
an assessment to fund advancement operations
	The annual assessment to fund CU Advancement operations is 1.5% of the market value of each endowment. The fee is calculated as of December 31 and paid on the following July 1 of each year.
rules relating to the suspension of distributions
	The Foundation suspends distributions from pure endowments when the endowment’s market value is less than 90% of its historic gift value.

Trustees
On behalf of CU Advancement, the Foundation convenes quarterly meetings of Trustees who are members of a national philanthropic council for the University of Colorado. Trustees serve as informed advocates for higher education and as ambassadors for CU. Trustees work with CU Advancement staff to help identify, cultivate and solicit prospective donors to CU. Trustees also commit to making personal gifts to CU at a level that reflects that CU is among their top philanthropic priorities. See a list of Trustees.

"CU Denver Torchbearers","
CU Denver is an urban university where talented students pursue academic, research and creative work that provides them with exceptional opportunities to learn with purpose. Their aims are furthered by generous private sector investments that support the contributions of CU Denver’s students, faculty and alumni to Colorado’s thriving population and economy.
The city is our campus
With no limiting boundaries between our campus and the city, students have easy access to the economic, cultural and political heart of the Rocky Mountain West and gain valuable hands-on experiences from CU Denver partnerships with business, industry and professional leaders.
Higher education is a path to the future
CU Denver’s dynamic academic leadership and urban setting attract students with clearly defined goals and the drive to succeed. Nearly half of all students are 25 or older, and half of those students work full or part time; more than one-third are first- generation attendees, and 30 percent are pursuing graduate degrees or certifications.
The future starts here
Amidst the area’s central business, cultural,
sports and government district, CU Denver offers unparalleled internship, networking and career, opportunities that augment coursework for the more than 100 undergraduate and graduate degrees awarded through its eight schools and colleges.
""Wherever you go, the university goes with you""
The insight that motivated former university president George Norlin continues to shape CU Denver’s academic and programmatic vision, as reflected in curricula that are continually updated for practical effectiveness, and in community and continuing education that are within reach of alumni and the general public.
Opportunities and areas of impact
Three of every four CU Denver students receive financial aid to offset costs of tuition, fees, materials and living expenses, although 66 percent of the assistance is in the form of loans that must be repaid.
The Experiential Learning Center was the first of its kind in the country to ensure one-stop support to connect students with hands-on learning outside the classroom, and success made it a model for other colleges and universities throughout North America.
The University Honors and Leadership Program enables high-achieving undergraduates to pursue an interdisciplinary curriculum that rewards intellectual curiosity and challenges them to expand their horizons by means of research, developmental and mentoring activities, and study abroad.

UCCS
CU Denver
CU Anschutz



The University of Colorado’s leadership annual giving society, the Torchbearers, celebrates our most generous annual donors.

These dedicated members annually contribute $1,000 or more and in doing so, have helped strengthen CU in significant ways.

""What the university purposes to be, what it must always strive to be, is represented on its seal, which is stamped on your diplomas—a lamp in the hands of youth. If its light shines not in you and from you, how great is its darkness! But if it shines in you today, and in the thousands before you, who can measure its power?""
– George Norlin, CU President, Summer 1935 Commencement address
