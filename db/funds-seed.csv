Faculty supporters shared:
""As your former faculty, we know most of you worked when we had you in class. In UCCS history, there has never been a time when there are so few student jobs available in our community. Our working students face a very difficult time. UCCS, unlike some other universities, is not cutting scholarships. However, hundreds of our students report they have lost their community jobs, many of which were in business sectors hit hardest including restaurants, retail and the tourism industry.
As long-standing faculty members, we ask you join us now in supporting scholarships for these deserving students so they can return and attend UCCS in Fall 2020. No gift is too small. This is our time to build a special legacy for the future.""
