Faculty supporters shared:
""As your former faculty, we know most of you worked when we had you in class. In UCCS history, there has never been a time when there are so few student jobs available in our community. Our working students face a very difficult time. UCCS, unlike some other universities, is not cutting scholarships. However, hundreds of our students report they have lost their community jobs, many of which were in business sectors hit hardest including restaurants, retail and the tourism industry.
As long-standing faculty members, we ask you join us now in supporting scholarships for these deserving students so they can return and attend UCCS in Fall 2020. No gift is too small. This is our time to build a special legacy for the future.""

For over four decades, Niwot Ridge Program has been measuring the air, snow, water, plants and animals in the highest mountains to better predict the future of water, wildlife, and snowpack -- in Boulder and beyond. We believe that the more we understand how and why these systems are changing, and the more we allow everyone to experience and learn about their wonders, the more we can help conserve and manage mountain alpine habitats. 
Studies in Niwot Ridge and Green Lakes Valley started in the 1940s, and include the longest running CO2 record in the continental US as well as measurements of temperature and snowpack since the 1950s. In 1980, the program became one of the original sites in the National Science Foundation's Long-term Ecological Research Network. Now reaching over 200 school-aged children, training over 30 undergraduate students, and involving over two dozen faculty across 8 departments at CU each year, it remains the only high mountain site in the network. 
This fund will support activities related to the Niwot Ridge Ecology Program, including student research, GK-12 educational programs, and community engagement.

These lost apples are nearing the ends of their lives, their rich diversity and history literally hanging on a limb.
The Boulder Apple Tree Project was started in 2017 to explore the identity and history of apple varieties in Boulder and the surrounding area in the hopes of saving these ""apples of old"" and improving future urban agricultural planning. The fund will support efforts to plant the descendants of the old trees in community teaching orchards, to involve CU students in these locally-relevant, experiential, and multidisciplinary research experiences, and to involve the Boulder community in collaborative learning that fosters a strong sense of place and university-communities ties.

"ALK+ Lung Cancer Colorado Fund","To support ALK Lung cancer research in honor of Emily Daniels at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
","CU Anschutz","","","","Science, Research & Innovation","School of Medicine, Medical Oncology","During November all gifts to ALK+ Lung Cancer Research will be doubled. By making a gift during Lung Cancer Awareness Month, you honor all the patients and families impacted by lung cancer.
We thank Emily Daniel’s parents, Ellen and Frank Rondi, and Nancee and Paul Pronsati, for matching all gifts up to $30K. As continued supporters and personally affected by lung cancer, they both wanted to do even more this year to ensure research continues during these unprecedented times.


At just 34 years old, Emily has been living with Stage IV lung cancer since her diagnosis in February 2018 at the age of 32, just before the birth of her second child. Although always health conscious, Emily, like many others she has met since her diagnosis, found this did not make her immune from this devastating disease. 
Luckily, Emily made her way to a world-renowned lung cancer oncologist, Ross Camidge, MD, Director of the Thoracic Oncology Clinical and Clinical Research Programs at CU. He and his team determined she had ALK positive non-small cell lung cancer. Dr. Camidge has pioneered clinical trials to increase treatment options for lung cancer driven by changes in the ALK gene. 
Since her diagnosis, Emily has received several targeted therapies, undergone a specific chemotherapy regimen and has had multiple radiotherapy treatments. Her last radiotherapy treatment in August, 2019 was for two small spots in her brain. By growing Emily’s live cells, Robert Doebele, MD, PhD, associate professor of medicine, determined that Emily has a rare form of cancer with a second pathway called MET driving her cancer. This life saving information led to the addition of a MET inhibitor to her treatment in January. As new advances are continually made at CU, it is hopeful that Emily will add a new MET inhibitor that crosses the blood brain barrier to her treatment in the near future. 
Emily and her husband Brian are trying to turn her disease into something positive as she has become an advocate for others. They actively raise funds for lung cancer research through their annual golf tournament, LINKS FOR LUNGS. It is their hope and that of their family and friends that one day lung cancer will become a chronic, rather than deadly disease.

","CU Boulder","","","","Community & Society","Program in Environmental Design","This studio course is an interactive design project that allows our Environmental Design students to work within the Boulder community, making a direct impact on the population and diversity of bees. 
Much of the current momentum behind ‘saving the bees’ focuses on honey bees; they are the poster child for the bee movement. But honey bees, not native to the US, only represent seven out of 3600+ bee species in the US alone. These bee species are broadly known as native bees, what we call “The Forgotten Hive”. Native bees are often more efficient and cost significantly less than honey bees, live in the ground and wood instead of hives, and many will not sting! 
This program supports our students in actively re-designing University of Colorado parking lot habitats to support native bees while improving their visual and ecological function. We partner with the Entomology Department and the Environmental Center, and our design students perform weekly studies to ensure our research is recorded and transferable to other cities and campuses. 
Your contribution will have a small but powerful effect on local bee habitat, helping to offset the negative impacts of urban development. With your help, we can change parks and parking lots across the country to support the forgotten hive and work towards a more sustainable, diverse future.

As the Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Success in the Division of Student Affairs, she helped to ensure services at CU Denver are welcoming and inclusive.
Peggy once noted, “Students have a lot of responsibilities in addition to going to school so sometimes I think if we don’t encourage students to develop things other than their academics, that students will be missing an opportunity. To me, it’s important for students to develop in a holistic way; benefitting from the full college experience.” ""

Thomas (“Tom”) J. Sterkel was a Colorado native and a Forever Buff. He grew up in Longmont, Colorado and graduated from the University of Colorado School of Business with a Bachelor of Science in Finance in 1974. During his time at CU, he played intramural basketball and after graduation he played club volleyball and basketball. Later in his life was an active cyclist and runner. Tom had a thirty-year career in the building industry along the Front Range of Colorado. Immediately prior to his death he was an employee owner of Alpine Lumber Company where he established their Truss Division in 1998. Friends and family were Tom’s first priority, but basketball was his special passion. He purchased his men’s basketball season tickets beginning in the inaugural year of Coors Events Center and rarely missed a game from that date in 1979 until his death in 2017. He was also a CU season football ticketholder and frequently travelled to sporting events with his wife Sarah, and his daughter, Tenley.

The CU Denver Asian American Student Services (AASS) office and university affiliates are pleased to announce the Peggy Lore Leadership Scholarship Fund. As a daughter of Chinese immigrants and a first-generation college student, Lore understands what it feels like to be “rooted in two cultures,” and she has experienced first-hand the obstacles many of our students face as they navigate the higher education.
Lore is known on campus for her knowledge and expertise on college climate and cultural issues that impact student success, retention and graduation. Through her work, Lore has imparted onto countless students the skills needed to surmount the sometimes daunting challenge of completing college.   As the Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Success in the Division of Student Affairs, she has helped to ensure services at CU Denver are welcoming and inclusive.
Scholarships will be given to student leaders who are contributing to the AAPI community through campus  and community organizations, actively engaged in social justice issues, and/or promoting traditional language and cultural practices.
“Students have a lot of responsibilities in addition to going to school,” said Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Success Peggy Lore, “so sometimes I think if we don’t encourage students to develop things other than their academics, that students will be missing an opportunity. To me, it’s important for students to develop in a holistic way; benefitting from the full college experience.” It is clear to see through her decades of dedication to student success that one of her greatest pleasures is working with students to help them achieve their goals, graduate, and live fulfilling lives.
